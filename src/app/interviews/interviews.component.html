          Polaroid - what i love is giving strangers I met a piece of our memory who I probably will
          never see again. That polorioaed is living proof that our memories are real.

        <p class="answer_text">
          In the future, I might
          even pass you on the streets, maybe of New York, and we probably won’t even
          recognise each other. Because the person we become will never be the same as the
          the childish, foolish, crazy one in our Polaroids.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          Also, it the person in our polaroid we will never meet again, it is a snapshot of who we were at exactly
          that time no matter how much we change later.

          What are the most common
          challenges for students to go backpacking?

        <p class="answer_text">
          <i>Time: </i>Time: I believe that if you love something, you would wake up wanting to do it tomorrow. For
          me, my biggest passion is travelling, so I will find time to travel, just like how everyone else will find
          time to watch netflix.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          <i>Finance: </i>There are plenty of ways to travel on a budget. With $1,000 and some travel budget management skills, you
          can basically go anywhere in the world. If you just make a small change to your spending, saving
          $100 per month, it could be easy as giving up Bubble Tea, you would be able to save $1,000 for 10
          months and can support yourself an once-in-life travel you’ve been dreaming of.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          <i>Safety: </i> I was very bold that I have been to some quite dangerous places, like anti-
          government concert in Santiago in Chile or streets with tear gas, fire ash and burnt after protest in
          Valparaiso in Chile. I was lucky enough to survive or be helped every time. Like when I was walking at
          Downtown Valparaiso, local residents, who do not speak English, used their body language to tell us
          not to go down the street anymore. When we happened to walk into some dangerous areas, we ask
          those security guard for direction and they just left their work and walk with us to the safe area.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          One tip I have to mention is that - try to use all the opportunities toconnect to people who
          speak the same language when you are at somewhere risky. But, if you do not go to somewhere risky, the odds of getting hurt is very small, if you have
          the awareness of protecting yourself and asking for help.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          <i>Company: </i>it is hard to find a travel company because who you are with will completely
          determine your experience. I have traveled with multiple people before. Everytime we have amazing
          memories but also a lot of problems. I am still good friends with them after the trip, but just be careful
          when you are selecting your travel company. It is important to communicate and know about what
          kind of travelers they are and what they expect from the trip. From my stories, you vff can probably see
          that I am a very open-minded and adventurous person who wants to talk to everyone and exploring
          exotic places, so I would get disappointed if my company is more sheltered and less willing to take the
          risk.

          Any other advice for backpacking newbies?
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          You don‘t have to be the craziest person that goes to the most exotic destination that you are not comfortable with. Honestly, just start from anywhere that you are curious about. Part of the
          important lesson to learn from backpacking is to be in a situation where you can be independent and
          you can make choices completely yourself, this is the best way to grow.
          Take care of your belongings, especially your passport and your phone. Not every country is
          safe like Canada.
        </p>
        <p class="answer_text">
          I don’t think you can perfectly prepare for your backpacking trip, just have a positive mindset
          all the time, and always have fun!

          As a huge foodie and health fanatic, I have finally became successful to lose weight without
          sacrificing the flavour and my favorite “junk” foods. I believe that you don’t have to compromise the
          taste of your favorite food to be skinny. You won’t believe how just switching from starch to shirataki
          noodles, cauliflower dough could change your life. I can make everyone’s favorite food with half of the
          normal calories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might be starting a blog to teach people how to make that. It is still in the progress. I
          will make an announcement when i am ready. So follow me on insta <u>[@feistyruiqi]!</u> Check it out if you
          wanna eat good food everyday without worrying about calories. And you are welcome to ask me any
          question about backpacking too!
